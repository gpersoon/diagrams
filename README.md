# Diagrams for Solidity contracts

## Why Diagrams

Effective way to get information into brain
- Use more senses
- Reduce load on short term memory
- Remember the protocol when revisiting it later
- Reduce initial information overload

Overview of protocol
- See complexity 
- Recognize patterns 
- Spot inconsistencies

Flexible
- Start with incomplete code
- Print and write on paper
- Develop top down
